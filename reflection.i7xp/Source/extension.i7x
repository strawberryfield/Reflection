	repeat with v running through the dictionary entries:
		unless v is verb-entry, next;
		if v is meta-entry, next;
		let cmd-alias be the command verb of v;
		let cte be the command table entry for cmd-alias;
		let cmd-action be the action name for cte;
		if "[cmd-action]" exactly matches the text "", next;
		say "[bold type][v][roman type]";
		unless "[v]" exactly matches the text "[cmd-alias]":
			say " [italic type](same as [roman type][cmd-alias][italic type]) [roman type][line break]";
		otherwise:
			let num-actions be the number of grammar lines for cmd-alias;
			say "[roman type]: [line break]";
			let skip next be false;
			repeat with x running from 1 to num-actions:
				if skip next is false, say "- [italic type][action name for cte][roman type][line break]";
				let O be action number of cte;
				let cte be the next command table entry of cte;
				let skip next be false;
				let A be action number of cte;
				if O is A, let skip next be true.
