Chapter Listing verbs

Listing verbs is an action out of world.
The listing verbs action translates into Inter as "VerbsList".
Understand "verbs" as listing verbs.
Understand the command "commands" as "verbs".

Report listing verbs (this is the report listing verbs rule):
	repeat with v running through the dictionary entries:
		unless v is verb-entry, next;
		if v is meta-entry, next;
		let cmd-alias be the command verb of v;
		let cte be the command table entry for cmd-alias;
		let cmd-action be the action name for cte;
		if "[cmd-action]" exactly matches the text "", next;
		say "[bold type][v][roman type]";
		unless "[v]" exactly matches the text "[cmd-alias]":
			say " [italic type](same as [roman type][cmd-alias][italic type]) [roman type][line break]";
		otherwise:
			let num-actions be the number of grammar lines for cmd-alias;
			say "[roman type]: [line break]";
			let skip next be false;
			repeat with x running from 1 to num-actions:
				if skip next is false, say "- [italic type][action name for cte][roman type][line break]";
				let O be action number of cte;
				let cte be the next command table entry of cte;
				let skip next be false;
				let A be action number of cte;
				if O is A, let skip next be true.

Chapter Listing grammar

Listing grammar is an action out of world.
The listing grammar action translates into Inter as "GrammarList".
Understand "grammar" as listing grammar.

Report listing grammar (this is the report listing grammar rule):
	repeat with v running through the dictionary entries:
		unless v is verb-entry, next;
		if v is meta-entry, next;
		let cmd-alias be the command verb of v;
		let cte be the command table entry for cmd-alias;
		let cmd-action be the action name for cte;
		if "[cmd-action]" exactly matches the text "", next;
		say "[bold type][v][roman type]";
		unless "[v]" exactly matches the text "[cmd-alias]":
			say " [italic type](same as [roman type][cmd-alias][italic type]) [roman type][line break]";
		otherwise:
			say "[roman type]: [line break]";
			say "[grammar lines content for cte]".
				
Chapter Listing dictionary

Listing dictionary is an action out of world.
The listing dictionary action translates into Inter as "DictionaryList".
Understand "dictionary" as listing dictionary.

Report listing dictionary (this is the report listing dictionary rule):
	repeat with d running through the dictionary entries:
		say "[bold type][d][roman type]: ";
		if d is meta-entry, say "meta ";
		if d is verb-entry, say "verb ";
		if d is preposition-entry, say "preposition ";
		if d is noun-entry, say "noun ";
		if d is plural-entry, say "[italic type](plural)[roman type]";
		say line break.
